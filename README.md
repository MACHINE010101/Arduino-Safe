# Arduino-Safe: A Digital Safe Simulation with Arduino Uno and Rich Shield

Arduino-Safe is a digital safe simulation project that combines the power of Arduino Uno and the versatile Arduino Rich Shield. This project allows you to create a secure digital safe that can be locked and unlocked using a 4-digit PIN. The safe provides a user-friendly interface for setting and entering the PIN, and it also includes an alarm feature for added security. With Arduino-Safe, you can experience the convenience and functionality of a digital safe system using readily available Arduino hardware and components.
